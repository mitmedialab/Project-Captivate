@par Example Description

Presentation of the MPU feature. This example configures a memory area as 
privileged read-only, and attempts to perform read and write operations in
different modes.

If the access is permitted LED2 is toggling. If the access is not permitted,
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.

To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, press 
user button.

@par Keywords

MPU, interrupt, MPU memory fault exception,
