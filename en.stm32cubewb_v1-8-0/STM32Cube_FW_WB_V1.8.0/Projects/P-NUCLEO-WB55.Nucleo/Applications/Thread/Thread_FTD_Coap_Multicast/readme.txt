@par Application Description

How to exchange multicast Coap messages.

This application requires two STM32WB55xx boards.

In a Thread network, nodes are split into two forwarding roles: Router or End Device.
The Thread Leader is a Router that is responsible for managing the set of Routers in a 
Thread network. An End Device (or child) communicates primarily with a single Router. 

In our Application which uses two devices, one device will act as a Leader (Router) 
and the other one will act as an End Device(mode child). 

After the reset of the 2 boards, one board will be in Leader mode (Green LED2 ON) 
The other one will be in Child mode (Red LED3 ON).
 
Let's name indifferently one board A and one board B. 
To send a COAP command from board A to board B, press the SW1 Push-Button on board A. 
The board B will receive the COAP command to light on its blue LED1. 
Pressing again same push-button will light off the blue LED1. And so-on. 
Same COAP commands can be sent from board B to board A.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices (Nucleo board and Dongle)
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB55 Nucleo or Dongle  
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - On STM32WB55RG_Nucleo, the jumpers must be configured as described
    in this section. Starting from the top left position up to the bottom 
    right position, the jumpers on the Board must be set as follows:

     CN11:    GND         [OFF]
     JP4:     VDDRF       [ON]
     JP6:     VC0         [ON]
     JP2:     +3V3        [ON] 
     JP1:     USB_STL     [ON]   All others [OFF]
     CN12:    GND         [OFF]
     CN7:     <All>       [OFF]
     JP3:     VDD_MCU     [ON]
     JP5:     GND         [OFF]  All others [ON]
     CN10:    <All>       [OFF]


@par How to use it ? 

This application requests having the stm32wb5x_Thread_FTD_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary. 


In order to make the program work, you must do the following: 
 - Connect 2 STM32WB55xx boards to your PC 
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files of Thread/Thread_FTD_Coap_Multicast application 
   and load your image into the target memory
 - Run the application

Note: when LED1, LED2 and LED3 are toggling it is indicating an error has occurred on application.

 If you want to control this application, you can directly send and
 retrieve Cli commands connecting an HyperTerminal with the ST_Link cable.
 (Refer to the Thread_Cli_Cmd application for more details) 
    
 if you want to get the traces in real time, you can connects an HyperTerminal 
 via an UART RS232 cable using the following connections :
  RXD : CN10(Pin35)   
  TXD : CN10(Pin37)
 
 
 For the Cli control and for the traces, the UART must be configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - Stop Bit = 1 bit
    - Parity = none
    - Flow control = none
 
  Note for addressing the low power :
  ----------------------------------
 To set the Application in full power mode, it is requested to set the define 
 CFG_FULL_LOW_POWER to 1 inside the app_conf.h file and to recompile the application.
 In this case, the Application is optimized in terms of power consumption.
 In this configuration,in order to save power,the LEDs are always powered off,
 the debugger cannot be attached any more to the target and there are no more traces.
