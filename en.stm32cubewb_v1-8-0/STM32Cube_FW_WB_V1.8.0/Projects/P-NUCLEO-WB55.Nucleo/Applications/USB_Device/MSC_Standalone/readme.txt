@par Application Description

This application shows how to use the USB device application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC) on the STM32WBxx devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the stm32wbxx USB OTG Device peripheral to communicate with a PC
Host using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent commands,
while the microSD card is used as storage media. The STM32 MCU is enumerated as a MSC device using the
native PC Host MSC driver to which the P-NUCLEO-WB55 board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK). The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an internal PLL.



When the application is started, the user has just to plug the USB cable into a PC host and the device
is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the system window and write/read/format
operations can be performed as with any other removable drive.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32WBxx devices.

  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics P-NUCLEO-WB55 boards
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  - P-NUCLEO-WB55 Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the P-NUCLEO-WB55 Adafruit Shield
    - Connect the P-NUCLEO-WB55 board to the PC through micro A-Male to standard A Male cable.
   cable to the connector: CN1: to use USB Full Speed (FS)



  - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN5,CN6, CN8 and CN9 Arduino connectors,
    for more details please refer to board User manual.
